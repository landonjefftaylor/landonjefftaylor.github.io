    <h1>Research Interests</h1>
    <p>
      My research interests include formal verification methods like model checking,
      Property-Directed Reachability (IC3), counterexample generation,
      and automated inductive proofs.
      My research is funded and overseen by Zhen Zhang at Utah State University.

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
      As I have explored programming languages and tools, I have built a handful
      of projects. Highlights include hundreds of thousands of Sudoku puzzles,
      a number of "random thing generators", and more.
      These are available on my Projects page and my GitHub profile.

    <h1>Open-Source Philosophy</h1>
    <p>
      My projects are all open-source, and I do my best not to require proprietary
      software prerequisites. Open-source software is better for everyone, and 
      providing my tools for free is my way of giving back to a community that 
      has poured resources into teaching me.
